# Reza's Data Analytics Portfolio

## Introduction
Hi!

Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Reza Muzhaffar Zidan and I am glad that you're here!

In this repository, you will find a collection of data analysis projects and visualizations that showcase my skills and experiences in the field of data analytics using tools that I often use. Each project is a testament to my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## About Me
I'm an Industrial and Systems Engineering fresh graduate from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of gaining valuable real-world experience through internships. One of the most eye-opening experiences was my internship in Business Intelligence at a logistics company. It was here that I witnessed the power of data-driven decision-making and its immense impact on supply chain operations.

But my learning journey didn't stop there. In 2022, I was honored to be selected as a Machine Learning Student in the prestigious Bangkit Academy led by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka, a program initiated by the Ministry of Education in Indonesia. This program has equipped me with cutting-edge knowledge and skills in the field of machine learning, enabling me to explore the endless possibilities of AI and Machine Learning in various applications.

## Projects

### Commercial Analysis Reporting using RMarkdown
**Code**: [`Commercial Analysis Report.Rmd`](https://github.com/rezamuzhaffar/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/R/Commercial%20Analysis%20Report/Commercial%20Analysis%20Report.Rmd)<br>
**Presentation**: [`Commercial Analysis Report.pptx`](https://github.com/rezamuzhaffar/data-analytics-portfolio/raw/main/R/Commercial%20Analysis%20Report/Commercial%20Analysis%20Report.pptx)<br>
RMarkdown's commercial analysis reporting script is a very useful tool for clients with pressing deadlines. It quickly transforms complicated data into understandable presentations using R programming, and the greatest part is that it produces these reports in PowerPoint. Therefore, this script has you covered whether you're crunching statistics or presenting insights, making research and reporting a breezeâ€”even on a tight schedule!

### Employee Attendance Report
**Dashboard**: [`Dashboard`](https://www.novypro.com/project/employee-attendance-dashboard)<br>
**File**: [`Employee Attendance Report.pbix`](https://github.com/rezamuzhaffar/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Power%20BI/Employee%20Attendance%20Report.pbix)<br>
The Employee Attendance Power BI Dashboard will provide the HR department at AtliQ Technologies with a powerful tool to gain deep insights into employee attendance trends, WFH preferences, and sick leave patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic era. The user-friendly interface and interactive data visualization will enable HR to make informed decisions, understand individual employee needs, and enhance workforce management strategies.
