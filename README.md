# Reza's Data Analytics Portfolio

## Introduction
Hi!

Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Reza Muzhaffar Zidan and I am glad that you're here!

In this repository, you will find a collection of data analysis projects and visualizations that showcase my skills and experience in the field of data analytics using tools that I often use. Each project is a testament to my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## About Me
I'm an Industrial and Systems Engineering fresh graduate from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. During my academic journey, I had the privilege of gaining valuable real-world experience through internships. One of the most eye-opening experiences was my internship in Business Intelligence at a logistics company. It was here that I witnessed the power of data-driven decision-making and its immense impact on supply chain operations.

But my learning journey didn't stop there. In 2022, I was honored to be selected as a Machine Learning Student in the prestigious Bangkit Academy led by Google, GoTo, and Traveloka, a program initiated by the Ministry of Education in Indonesia. This program has equipped me with cutting-edge knowledge and skills in the field of machine learning, enabling me to explore the endless possibilities of AI and Machine Learning in various applications.
