# Power BI Data Visualization

Welcome to my Power BI Data Visualization portfolio!

To view a showcase of my projects where I used Power BI to transform difficult data into understandable insights, click the link below. These visual aids are more than simply graphs and charts; they tell tales that come to life as you explore. These interactive dashboards and reports are made to make comprehending data simple, regardless of whether you're a decision-maker or a data enthusiast. Come along with me on this data adventure at [My Power BI Showcase](https://www.novypro.com/profile_projects/reza-muzhaffar-zidan), and together, let's unleash the power of your data!

The Employee Attendance Power BI Dashboard will provide the HR department at AtliQ Technologies with a powerful tool to gain deep insights into employee attendance trends, WFH preferences, and sick leave patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic era. The user-friendly interface and interactive data visualization will enable HR to make informed decisions, understand individual employee needs, and enhance workforce management strategies.
