# Machine Learning Modeling

Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio!

In this directory, you'll embark on a journey through my exploration of the amazing field of machine learning. This portfolio is a showcase of my passion for leveraging data to make informed decisions, from diving into classic algorithms to tackling real-world problems with cutting-edge techniques. Join me in exploring artificial intelligence and witness the magic of turning data into actionable insights, whether you're a fellow enthusiast or a curious explorer.

### Lending Club Credit Risk Modeling
**Code**: [`Lending Club Credit Risk Modeling.ipynb`](https://github.com/rezamuzhaffar/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Lending%20Club%20Credit%20Risk%20Modeling.ipynb)<br>
On this data, there are many columns describe the details of the loan transaction in the lending company. The information we can get from the columns is such as loan amount, term of the loan, grade of the borrower, and many more. The latest transaction status can be accessed in `loan_status` column which will be the target of the model we will develop. This model aims to predict whether borrowers will be likely to be able to repay the loans they apply for or will default. From this perspective, we can get the analytical approach questions for end-to-end credit risk modeling like:
- How do you approach data cleaning and preprocessing for credit risk modeling?
- What are the important variables you would consider in a credit risk dataset, and how would you deal with missing data?
- How would you address the class imbalance in the dataset when selecting a credit risk model?
- How do you compare the pros and cons of the machine learning models you will use for the credit risk modeling?
